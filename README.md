# Dot 2 Dot
*Overview*: This game is similar to connect 4. In the connect 4, the first person to connect 4 circles diagonally wins. But, in this game,  a user has to do more than connect 4 circles (dots) to win the game entirely.  

## Rules
- The objective of the game is to get more squares than your opponent while not putting themselves in a position to lose as few of squares as possible.
 - The player can lose a square if they are the third line in a square of 4 dots. If the player gets a square, the player’s initial or chosen color is either inside the box (initial) or fills the box (color).   
- The smallest dimension is 8 (across) by 8 (down).
- In the event of a tie, the down dimension stays the same and while the across dimension is halfed. So for the 8 by 8, it will be 4 by 8. 
    - Continue the game until a user gets a square. So, it’s a sudden death game.
- A user doesn’t lose entirely if 
    - They lose a square. 
- If a user wins a square,  
    - They get another turn to draw a line.

### Winning Entirely
    - The amount of squares they have created exceeds the number the of dots it is possible to connect to.  
    - If they have more squares than their opponent at the end of the game. The end of the game is defined by no more dots to connect lines to.
    - It is not possible for the other user to win due to the aforementioned reasons.
