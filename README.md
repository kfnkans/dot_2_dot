## Dot 2 Dot ("Connect 4" but better)
Rules
Overview: This game is similar to connect 4. In the connect 4, the first person to connect 4 circles diagonally wins. But, in this game,  a user has to do more than connect 4 circles (dots) to win the game entirely.  

The objective of the game is to get more squares than your opponent. In addition,  the player has to avoid putting themselves in a position to lose a square or as few of squares as possible. The player can lose a square if they are the third line in a square of 4 dots. If the player gets a square, the player’s initial or chosen color is either inside the box (initial) or fills the box (color).   
The smallest dimension is 8 (across) by 8 (down).
In the event of a tie, the down dimension stays the same and while the across dimension is halfed. So for the 8 by 8, it will be 4 by 8. 
Continue the game until a user gets a square. So, it’s a sudden death game.
A user doesn’t lose entirely if 
They lose a square. 
If a user wins a square,  
They get another turn to draw a line. 
A user wins if 
The amount of squares they have created exceeds the number the of dots it is possible to connect to.  
If they have more squares than their opponent at the end of the game. The end of the game is defined by no more dots to connect lines to.
It is not possible for the other user to win due to the aforementioned reasons.
